      Sorry we did tried as much as possible not to re-invent wheel, picplx app is built on existing technologies as:<br> MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Beanstalkd, Supervisor, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, Playframework, Nginx and couple of hacks around.
      But for this open source version i have taken off some in house dev stuff, and what we think its necessary for public, we keep them open :). Hopefully during the second version release we will add more to it like how we are using Beanstalkd and Node.js, and other crazy tools :).
      Ola and I love building things and when we are not too busy we give ourselves challenges to hack things. We will release version 2.0 (which will be ported to Python/Tornado/Django) along side with its Android all open sourced by the April ending.
